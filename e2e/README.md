# End-to-end tests

Playwright tests that drive the real app (production build of `client/` + `server/`) in a browser.
The server's `@rtsdk/topia` calls go to `mock-topia/server.mjs`, an in-memory fake of the Topia public
API, so no Topia credentials, world or network access are needed. The PR check (`E2E`) runs them on
every push; see `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` (managed by Terraform in config_texts).

## Run

```bash
npm install                      # app deps, repo root
cd e2e
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
npm test                         # builds the app, starts the mock + app, runs all specs
npm run test:ui                  # interactive mode
```

Against the Docker image instead of local Node (what ships; needs Docker):

```bash
e2e/scripts/test-image.sh        # image exactly as the Dockerfile builds it
e2e/scripts/test-image.sh 24     # --build-arg NODE_VERSION=24, fails unless the image runs Node 24
```

Ports: app `3100`, mock `3101` (override with `APP_PORT` / `MOCK_TOPIA_PORT`).

## Layout

| Path | What it is | When forking into a new app |
|---|---|---|
| `tests/platform/` | Checks every SDK app must pass: health endpoint contract, app shell fallback, credential checks, the interactive secret never reaching the browser | Keep identical; only edit `app.config.ts` |
| `app.config.ts` | The app's credentialed API routes, their known bugs, the entry page and the app shell marker | List every route that calls `getCredentials`; set `APP_SHELL_MARKER` if the page isn't a React root |
| `tests/app/` | Poll's own tests: `player.spec.ts` (voting, results), `admin.spec.ts` (create, edit, reset), `security.spec.ts` (rules the server must enforce) | Replace with tests for the app's own pages and rules |
| `fixtures.ts` | `world.seed({...})` builds one isolated Topia world per test; `world.url()` / `world.api()` add the session credentials Topia appends. `poll({...})` builds a poll data object, `players` seeds other visitors (open the app as one with `world.as()`) | Extend `seed` for the app's data objects |
| `mock-topia/server.mjs` | Fake Topia public API. Like the real one, world routes reject calls with neither an API key nor an interactive JWT carrying a nonce, `GET .../assets/:id` returns the data object with the asset, a held `lockId` answers 409, and analytics sent with data-object writes land in the event log | Add routes for any endpoint the app calls that isn't there |

Every test gets its own world, so the suite runs fully in parallel. Each test also fails if the app
calls a public-API endpoint the mock doesn't implement, so an `@rtsdk/topia` upgrade that starts using
new endpoints can't pass silently. A full app example lives in sdk-quiz (`e2e/tests`).

## Known bugs

Tests for bugs that still exist are marked `test.fail(...)`: they pass while the bug is there and
fail with "Expected to fail, but passed" once it's fixed, so the marker is removed in the same change
as the fix. In `tests/platform/` the markers come from `knownBugs` on each route in `app.config.ts`
(and `ENTRY_PAGE_KNOWN_BUGS` for the page load), so the specs stay identical across apps.

| Test | Bug | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `platform/credentials.spec.ts` "names the credential problem" (`unnamedCredentialError`) | `getCredentials` returns `{ error }` instead of throwing, so requests with bad credentials carry on and fail later on a Topia call. | Throw from `getCredentials` (protected file: fix in sdk-ai-boilerplate). Tracked in EXP-428. |
| `platform/credentials.spec.ts` `GET /visitor` missing / foreign credentials | `getVisitor` returns `{ error }`, so `/visitor` answers 200 with an empty visitor. | Throw from `getVisitor`. EXP-438 #7. |
| `app/security.spec.ts` "admin routes reject players" (3) | `PUT /poll` and `POST /admin/reset` never check `isAdmin`. | EXP-438 #1. |
| `app/security.spec.ts` "one vote per player" (2) | `/vote` counts the vote for the body's `profileId`. | Use `credentials.profileId`. EXP-438 #2. |
| `app/security.spec.ts` "twenty players voting at once" | `/vote` writes back whole `options`/`results` from a stale read; simultaneous votes are lost. | EXP-438 #3. |
| `app/security.spec.ts` "only real answers can be voted for" (4) | `optionId` isn't checked; votes are accepted with no poll configured. | EXP-438 #4. |
| `app/security.spec.ts` "players don't receive who voted for what" | `GET /poll` returns `results` keyed by profileId. | EXP-438 #5. |
| `app/security.spec.ts` "poll settings are validated by the server" (3) | 10-answer, 150/100-character and display-mode limits exist only in the form. | EXP-438 #6. |
| `app/admin.spec.ts` "after Reset the admin sees the empty poll" | Reset never updates the page. | EXP-438 #7. |

The platform secret tests pass here: no normal response carries an SDK object (EXP-429 doesn't apply).

## Conventions

- New tests are mutation-checked: break the behavior in the app and confirm the test goes red.
- Before merging, `npx playwright test --repeat-each=3` must pass every time.
